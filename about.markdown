I'm Matt Kuhn! A Cincinnati-based husband, father, and software developer. I'm most experienced with enterprise-level solutions using the OOP languages like Java and C#. 

- I view software as as a tool for automating well-understood processes. 
- I view software development as the codification of that knowledge. 
- I view software developers as authors of that code. 
- I view code as literature (like an instruction manual or a textbook).
