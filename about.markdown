I'm Matt Kuhn! A Cincinnati-based husband, father, and software developer for the web. I'm most experienced with enterprise-level solutions using the OOP languages like Java and C#. 

- I see software as an automation tool for well-known processes. 
- I see software development as the authorship of the code for automation. 
- I see software developers as teams of authors who translate knowledge into code.
- I see code as written executable knowledge.
