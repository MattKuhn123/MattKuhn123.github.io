I'm Matt Kuhn! A Cincinnati-based husband, father, and software developer for the web. I'm most experienced with enterprise-level solutions using the OOP languages like Java and C#. 

- I view software as as a tool for automating well-understood processes. 
- I view software development as the codification of that knowledge. 
- I view developers as authors of that code. 
- I view code as literature (Sometimes informational like an instruction manual, sometimes poetic like a haiku).
