# Unsolvable Problems

## In Marriage 

In the first few years of our marriage, my wife and I had some relational issues which we sought help for in marital counseling. Our counselor showed us a theory from the Gottman Institute that a certain percentage of problems in marriage are _"unsolvable"_.

I've forgotten the fine details of this theory, but an LLM summarizes it as having to do with personality differences and lifestyle needs. 

_"Unsolvable"_ sounds more grim than it really is. The term _really_ refers to the subjective nature of marital issues. One such issue, for example, might be; _who should do the dishes?_ (a light-hearted subject should do for the purposes of this article!) For this issue, there is no universally applicable rule to inform what the couple should do. If each spouse was raised in a household that handled it differently, they'll come into the marriage with different expectations, and conflict will surely follow.

Even if the spouses communicate and come to a compromise (as they'll need to), is the problem truly _"solved"_? Suppose one (or both) of the spouse(s) isn't completely satisfied with the solution, but is willing to deal with their dissatisfaction for the sake of the relationship. 

The things a spouse has to endure for the sake of the relationship is an essential part of their maturity; they learn to put others' needs first and perhaps even learn to sacrifice their own desires. Thus fulfilling the proverb _"Suffering produces character."_

## In Product Teams

I think the concept of _"unsolvable problems"_ translates well to the relationships in a software development product team. Doesn't each member of the team also come with different personalities and needs? Like dish-washing in a marriage, product teams also have _"unsolvable problems"_. You can imagine that even in the best case (where teams have retrospectives and communicate internally) individual team members will _still_ have to compromise on their ideals for the sake of collaboration.

For example: 

1. **How to define work**: Business analysts might find themselves having to divide tasks into ever smaller steps... _OR_ sometimes combine them, according to the apparently arbitrary whims of fickle software engineers.
2. **How to work together to write code _(how pairing should go, or how to conduct PRs)_**: Experienced engineers may have to find a balance of hands-on and hands-off guidance for the less-experienced engineers. The amount of guidance they need (or want) is a constantly moving target.
3. **How to format and structure the code**: Software engineers who like to use lambdas may have to stop using them if the _team_ finds them too difficult to debug. Some choices are just a matter of opinion constructed by an individual's priorities and their pragmatic trade-offs.

# Conclusion

The attitude I often see in individuals of product teams is a _"resigned fatalism"_ about how bad the teams' systems are. Perhaps it's okay for us to hold on to the idea that things can (maybe even _should_) be better, **_but_** also to see shortcomings as opportunities for us to show our character in the face of adversity.
