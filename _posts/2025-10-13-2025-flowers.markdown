# Flowers

I have to go to work today.

I hate to leave you here at home, but you'll have fun with Mom! Trust me, it's not like it would be a carnival if I stayed here anyway.

I really do like my job. I've become good at it (over time), and I like the people I work with. I try to do well, not to prove anything, nor because I'm such a company man. Mostly, I just do it for an income to provide for you guys. I wouldn't do it otherwise.

It's true that a job well done _is_ it's own reward, but work is not an end unto itself. There's no such thing as a professional wet-bag-of-salt-schlepper. Work only has meaning inside of a greater context. 

I just focus on the reason that I work and the thing that matters most: you guys.

So, tonight on the way home from work, I'm going to stop somewhere and get your mother some flowers to thank her for being that main party that moves us forward.
