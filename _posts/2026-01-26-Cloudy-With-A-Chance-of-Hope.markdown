## Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs

I recently watched an animated children's movie that triggered me to consider another perspective about AI.

Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs is the story of a quirky inventor with world-changing potential. He grew up in a town where, due to external circumstances, the only available food was sardines. One day, he invented a device that converted water into any imaginable food! Unfortunately, he couldn’t power it himself; so, he secretly tapped into an external power source. He didn’t anticipate (though perhaps, if he were responsible, he should have anticipated) what happened next: plugging it in triggered a massive explosion that destroyed half the town and sent his device flying into the sky! However, through sheer dumb luck, his device was still functional; and not only was it functional; it was also sufficiently powered and supplied to serve the entire town.  

Although they were at first angry and confused, the townspeople eventually realized they could harness this power. They asked for any food they wanted, and it fell from the sky like rain. The quirky inventor devised some technologies to support his food invention. He invented a device that cleaned up the leftovers by literally catapulting them “out of sight” beyond a dam outside of the town. He also invented a device that monitored the level of “danger” that the device posed to the town (which is something he didn’t pay very close attention to).  

The townspeople and the mayor all loved these inventions and loved their inventor, and they all grew fat and happy because of him. The mayor especially so! He was finally achieving his dream of becoming a big mayor of a big town.  

Amid this flourishing, there was one lone resident of the town who looked around and said “this isn’t natural” ... “I’m not sure this is good for people!”  

His insight triggered me to think of what this story means in the context of AI.  

## How is this related to AI?

Where did AI come from? AI was largely created secretly and illegally, trained on stolen copyrighted material. That's on display in court cases of several artists, authors, and others against the AI companies.  

Is AI a sustainable technology? Can our infrastructure and natural environment support the power requirements for their datacenters? Or are we simply launching our problems "out of sight" to deal with later?  

Is AI good for people? We’re seeing potentially massive productivity gains in the workplace, but will our skills atrophy when we depend on AI to do our tasks instead of doing them ourselves? And, in our schools, isn’t it clearly a detriment to our our students?  

## What happens in the movie?

Eventually, the town’s fortune changed. The danger monitoring system was ignored for too long. The water-to-food converter started generating dangerously large portions of food. The food that rained from heaven crushed the buildings beneath. The dam that had been holding back all the leftovers eventually succumbed to the pressure and broke.  

I don’t know what the worst could be that would happen to our society if our worst fears about AI came true, but I also don’t necessarily want to think in terms of the worst possible scenario. In the movie, the town faces its destruction. I’m not saying that our society faces destruction, but I certainly do not naively believe that nothing bad can come from abusing such incredible technology.   

The townspeople united to flee the town while the quirky inventor and his friends made a desperate effort to destroy the device. They succeeded in disabling it (and presumed it destroyed). The town was reduced to rubble, but the people were saved!  

In my opinion, that’s the most important part of the movie. Yes, the town was destroyed, but the people were saved. The optimist sees the same glimmer of hope as we face AI. Whatever promises and dangers it offers, we can turn away from it (whatever that looks like) and avoid mortal peril. 

## The Sequel: Adding a bit of nuance 

In Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2, the townspeople had to vacate their town to make room for a cleaning operation. However, as I foreshadowed earlier, the device was not destroyed. It continued to mutate and create new kinds of food; living food. When the people returned, they found an entirely new and fantastic world. Initially there was conflict, but it was resolved! (I’m giving the short version). The sequel shows us that the device *itself*, is not good or evil; it depends on the context it is used in. I see the same dynamic with AI.
