# Developers at play

## Puppies

An Australian Heeler puppy was once playing with her little sister. The two played until a disagreement arose between them. They debated the issue until the older proved herself right and her sister wrong once and for all. The younger sister ran off misty-eyed to her room, bringing an end to their play and leaving the older alone and confused.

The older asked their mother what went wrong, and her mother replied _"Well, do you want to be right? Or do you want to keep playing with your sister?"_

## Rats

A Canadian psychologist, professor, and podcast host once studied the behavior of rats as they play-wrestled. He observed that between rats of significantly different size, the larger rat will sometimes allow the smaller rat to win. If the larger rat doesn't allow the smaller rat to win every once in a while, then the smaller rat will eventually refuse to play at all. Then, no one's happy!

## Software developers

In our field, we're particular about the verifiability of correctness. Every observable behavior of an application is always _right_ or _wrong_; therefore, _developers_ are always either right or wrong. We rightly value being right, and we _want_ to be right all the time. But every once in a while, we should self-evaluate. Have we been _winning_ everything? Do other members of the team still want to play with us?

Sometimes, it is good to allow others to have their way. Is there wiggle room in the way that the code can be written? Can the API design be made slightly flexible to accommodate one of your consumers? If you had the design your way, maybe it would run more efficiently... Or perhaps the code would be more readable... But by how much? Would anyone notice? Also, are you so sure about that? Maybe you should give your teammate more space to flesh-out their idea; you might learn something!

If you happen to be the smartest guy on the whole internet do others see you as a dominating force, or a servant-hearted resource? Do you empower your teammates? Or do you crush them?

## Conclusion

When cartoon puppies agree with wrestling rats, its time for us all to sit down and listen. Being a software developer is about a lot more than just winning!
