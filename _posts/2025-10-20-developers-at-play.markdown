# Developers at play

## Puppies

A certain _(cartoon)_ Australian Heeler puppy was once playing with her sister until a disagreement arose between them. The two playfully debated the issue until the older proved herself right and her sister wrong once and for all.

The misty-eyed younger sister ran off, bringing an end to their play and leaving the older alone and confused.

The older asked their mother for help; to which the mother advised _"Do you want to be right? Or do you want to keep playing with your sister?"_ as if the options were mutually exclusive!

## Rats

A certain Canadian professor and psychologist _(in real life, not a cartoon)_ shared in his podcasts and lectures that rats have a certain pattern behind their play-wrestling behavior. Between rats of significantly different size, the larger rat will allow the smaller rat to win a portion of the time. If the larger rat doesn't allow the smaller rat to win every once in a while, then the smaller rat will eventually refuse to play. Now no one's happy!

## Software developers

Software developers daily find themselves in similar situations as wrestling rats and playful puppies. Situations where they have the opportunity to be right, to _win_ and to _dominate_. But does one always want to be _right_? It might feel it necessary to have their way in order to maintain the integrity of the program. The _program_ must be right, there's no doubt about that.

But is it sometimes worth it to allow small victories to others? Is there wiggle room in the way that the code is written? Can the API design be made slightly flexible to accommodate one of your consumers? If you had the design your way, maybe it would run more efficiently... Or perhaps the code would be more readable... But by how much? Would anyone notice? (Also, are you sure about that? Is it just a matter of opinion?)

Are you giving space to your peers to allow them to make mistakes and grow? (Not too terribly _dangerous_ of mistakes, of course. You don't want to be irresponsible about it.)

## Conclusion

When cartoon dogs agree with the results of a psychological analysis of the play behavior of lab rats, its time for us all to sit down and listen. Being a software developer is about a lot more than just being right all the time.
