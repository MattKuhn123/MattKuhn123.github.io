# Spirit of Adventure

It was with the spirit of adventure that you to started writing that new code.

You weren't sure exactly where it would lead, even if you had a vision for it.

It had never been done before; at least, not exactly the way it needed to be done in _this_ case. If it had, then there wouldn't be a need for you to write it! 

You entered uncharted territory, hoping to capture something useful.

This time you were lucky; you were able to write something functional. As a matter of fact, you were _extra_ lucky; it turned out not only to be _functional_, but _useful_ as well! 

Congratulations! You have spoken order out of chaos. You've divided the depths. Your code is no longer uncharted territory; it is now mapped in world of Useful Ideas.

Your spirit of adventure was fruitful; and with it, you have brought back a discovery to be examined in the lab.

Just like all scientific inquiry; what once began as a felt-need and an optimistic curiosity has matured into a subject matter with categories and classifications. Your code represents a _domain_ of knowledge. It's a full-blown mental model written in your programming language. (Actually; it's _more_ than _just_ a mental model; it's executable!)

What was once suitable for your specific needs will be adapted to the needs of the community.

Others will come to look at your code. You will re-examine your own code.

It will be _refactored_!

- You'll find patterns and opportunity for useful abstraction.
- You'll find simpler ways of framing complex concepts.
- You'll address the shortcomings of the original solution.

It was difficult to get out there in the beginning; but you were able to get through it with the right mix of vision, luck, and spirit of adventure!
